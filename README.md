# AICodesTransFeminineQuiz
This Repository is just a way to publish me testing a bunch of different AI's to see how well they can make a trans feminine quiz.
Models Used: Grok, DeepSeek, ChatGPT and Claude. If you have any more, reach out!
Here's the exact prompt I used for each and all of them: "code me a program with a gui that is a quiz to help me identify where I am transgender, (Specifically transfeminine) using randomly generated questions by connecting to the internet (still using the relevant subject matter) and make it a max of 20 questions and with the answers provided, tell the user whether they might be transfeminine or not"
